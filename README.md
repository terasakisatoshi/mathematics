# WELCOME TO MATHEMATICS

I will make some topics about mathematics.

$$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} $$

The equation above is written by MathJax engine.

~~The equation above is written by KaTeX engine.See more detail:https://github.com/GitbookIO/plugin-katex~~

I will use KaTex engine when gitbook supports decent shape of `\boldsymbol` for greek symbol.

inline mode:

$$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} $$

Block math:
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}}
$$
